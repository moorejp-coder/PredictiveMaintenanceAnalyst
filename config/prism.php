| Every limit the risk checks use lives here, with its source. This file
| returns a plain array and calls no Laravel helper, so unit tests load it
| without booting the app (see App\Services\Limits).
|
| Sources:
| - AI4I limits: AI4I 2020 dataset documentation (Matzka, 2020). The heat,
|   power and overstrain rules reproduce every label in the 10,000 records.
| - Vibration: ISO 10816-3 Group 2 zone boundaries. Not in AI4I, not backtested.
| - Run hours: demo placeholder. Not in AI4I, not backtested.
